//code functionality that makes a click event that will randomize videos for the showcase of artists and their work
//to further detail the functionality:
    //make it so each click will randomly produce a video (along with the correct artist name above said video)
    //I'd assume Angular would be proper for this kind of functionality. Each of the 3 or 6 sub sections //will contain an array of videos that can be called (maybe randomly, probably not for practicality)
//use angular to call an array for the carousel content
//make sure all the content is stored on the machine, aside from the youtube videos. It'll probably make load quicker.
